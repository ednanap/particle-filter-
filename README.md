# Particle Filter Localisation

The goal of this project was to implement, analyze, and gain a deeper understanding of the Particle Filter Localization Algorithm, specifically a version known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). The project was executed through a simulation using ROS-Stage and Rviz, and it was coded in Python.

To develop the localization node, I built upon the provided skeleton code, available at (https://github.com/catherine2103/pf_localisation). For the practice exercise, I used the map included in the "socspioneer" package. Alongside the main steps of Particle Filtering— motion update, sensor update, and re-sampling—we also explored methods for generating a single pose estimate of the robot at each time step and addressed the “kidnapped robot” problem. This project is an assignment assigned to me by the University of Edinburgh, I was unsatisfied with the result thus it is on my github so I could come up with a better solution.
